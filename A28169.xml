            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And as it is given to us, to change and renew us in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note n="(k)" place="margin">Eph. 4. 23.</note> of our Minds; So we may truly give up to it, that it may work a thorough and effectual Change in us, <hi>Tranſlating us, out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Dear Son of God;</hi> and to poſſeſs that Treaſure of Eternal Life, <hi>that neither Moth can Eat,</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57612:5"/> and the reproofs thereof have followed them, yet they have not truly turned at the Reproofs thereof, and ſo not received the Truth in the Love of it; but are ſuch as the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. Deſcribes, <hi>Who hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and the Wrath of God is Revealed from Heaven againſt ſuch;</hi> and he gives the Reaſon for it in the next Verſe, <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> So that it is not holding barely a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Truth that will do us any good, but it is a being Renewed in our Minds; or elſe, whatever we may Profeſs, the Wrath of God abides upon us: So that we are not only to Profeſs the Truth, but to Love it above all things, and to yield Obedience to it; for our Love to Chriſt Jeſus the Truth is manifeſted by our Obedience and Subjection to him, it being in vain to pretend we Love him, whil'ſt we are not willing to Bow to him, and to let him have the Government
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57612:5"/> of our Minds. <hi>If you Love me</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>keep my Commandments,</hi> John 14. 15. And again, <hi>He that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that Loveth me; and he that Loveth me, ſhall be Loved of my Father; and I will Love him, and Manifeſt my ſelf to him,</hi> Verſe 21. Again Jeſus ſaid, <hi>If a Man Love me, he will keep my Words</hi> (and he adds a Bleſſed and Comfortable Promiſe to ſuch that thus Love him) <hi>and my Father will Love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him,</hi> Verſe 23. And ſeeing none are Lovers of him but theſe who keep his Commandments, and keep his Words and Sayings, how do's it behove us to come to a ſtrict and thorough ſearch? Are we keeping his <hi>Commandments,</hi> his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sayings:</hi> You know the tendency of all the Words, Sayings and Commandments of our Lord was to bring Man to the Knowledge of his Power, and the Work of it in them, that they might come to be Sanctified by his Word<note n="(n)" place="margin">Joh. 17. 17.</note> which is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57612:6"/> 
               <hi>Truth,</hi> and Born again<note n="(o)" place="margin">John 3. 3, 8.</note> of the Spirit, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it no Man can enter the Kingdom of God; and alſo to rectifie Man both in Life and Manners, that as Man was gone away from his Primitive State of Holineſs, into the Dark World; he, by obſerving his Word of Life, and keeping of his Commandments, might come up again in that Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory from which he was fallen, to Love and Fear God, who hath given him Life and Being. And where this Love is thus ſeated in the Heart, and lived in, it will naturally lead to forſake all things that offends him, and hurts and hinders the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth, and the Glory of his Name; For it is not a ſhew or bare pretence of Loving him that will Intitle us to the Bleſſed Promiſe, of <hi>He and his Fathers Loving them, and coming to make their Abode with them;</hi> For as it is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>John, If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 John
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57612:6"/> 2. 15. And it is ſaid by our Lord, <hi>He that Loveth</hi>
               <note n="(p)" place="margin">Mat. 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Father, Mother, Wife or Children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>better than me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we muſt not Love things that are both good and lawful in themſelves, and juſtifiable for us to have, enjoy and love, in their places, better than the Lord, but he muſt have the Mind and Affections above and beyond the Love of them, then our Love to theſe things muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the Love we muſt have to him; nor muſt we let our Minds, Love or Affections be at all after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful things, as the<note n="(q)" place="margin">James 4. 4.</note> Friendſhip and Favour of this World, for that is at Enmity with God; nor after Covetouſneſs and Pride, the Luſt, Pleaſure and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, for they are Evil, and expreſly forbidden; and therefore as the Apoſtle ſaid,<note n="(r)" place="margin">Col. 2. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Touch not, taſt not, handle not;</hi> for they Defile, and make unfit to draw nigh to God, or to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57612:7"/> with him and his Beloved Son, who came to Redeem us from ſuch things.</p>
            <p>Now they that know the Truth, well know, that the Truth calls out of ſuch things, to abandon, forſake and withſtand them, in every of their Appearances, and to War againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtful Luſt that Wars againſt the Soul; and does not only call for this Reſiſting of them, but will enable every one that ſubmits to it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to overcome theſe Snares and Temptations; and ſo not to be Slaves, and brought into Bondage by Evil, but to be Victors over it.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding God has given this knowledge and inveſted man with a Divine Power, if he will yet give way to theſe things, and gratifie his vain and unbridled Mind, and will harbour them in his Heart, and live in them, though he offends by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and becomes an ill Example to others; ſuch will unavoidably bring themſelves under the Character the

               <hi>Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of God,</hi> and muſt Reap the Reward of their ſo doing; and therefore will not be found worthy of him, who is come out of the Boſom of the Father, to Reſtore poor loſt Man to God again; nor of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Peace which he brings all thoſe who receive him in that Love in which the Father ſent him.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57612:9"/> Jeſus, nor the good of his Flock; is not tender, but is unnatural and cruel, will Sacrifice the good of Souls, and the peace of the Church to gain its own ends; this is that Spirit which the Apoſtle Warned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> and is not to be ſuffered in God's Camp; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Watch againſt it, and its Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, where-ever it appears, and look upon it as a deadly Enemy to God, and True Religion, and dangerous to the Peace of the Church, which ought to be prefer'd above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any private Intereſt whatſoever.

            <p>For the Holy Apoſtle was truly Senſible of this, when he ſaid, <hi>Though</hi>

            <p>Now, that theſe Bleſſed Fruits and Effects of the Love of God, ſhed abroad in our Hearts, we may be found in, that they may be as Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon us, and we may Shine

            </p>
            <p>And as we keep in the Wiſdom and Counſel of God, Peace and Unity will be Promoted; Fervent Charity, Brotherly Kindneſs, and Bearing one with another in a Spirit of Love will increaſe, and thereby the Sincere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, the Feeble Strengthened, the Heady and High-minded Rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the Backſlider brought back, the Careleſs and Negligent awakened and ſtirred up to Faithfulneſs and Diligence, that nothing but Love and Truth may have any place amongſt us; then ſhall God have his Honour, and we the Comfort of the Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Living God amongſt us.</p>

               <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall Worſhip the Father in Spirit and Truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to Worſhip him.</hi> Now as the true Worſhip ſtands in Spirit, they that are performers of it, muſt be in the Spirit; that is, they muſt be Spiritually-minded, their Hearts and Souls muſt be turned to this Spirit, waiting to feel the Work of it, both to fit them, by taking away and Purging them from every thing, that makes them unfit for ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57612:11"/> great an Exerciſe as that is, to waſh from all Corruptions, and to draw the Mind out of that which would defile it; for whil'ſt the Heart is defiled, it is not fit for this Worſhip: As God is Holy, ſo is his Worſhip, and it muſt be peform'd by a Heart and Mind that is made ſo, or elſe we ſhall have ſuch a return as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had of Old, by the Prophet,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Iſa. 1. 12, 13, 15.</note>

            </p>
            <p>So that it is in vain for People to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach before the Lord with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Corrupt Heart and Mind; Man has nothing to do to tread his Courts till a Reformation, in ſome meaſure, be wrought, and that they know Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and an earneſt Willingneſs and Deſire to have their Hearts Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>So that it is evident, People muſt come rightly prepared, or elſe they have no right to tread his Courts, nor to offer any thing as a Sacrifice to him. And therefore let every Mind (eſpecially when met together in our Solemn Meetings, for it is not barely coming there, and hearing what may be ſpoken there, but every one muſt be) turned in, to the Gift of God's Spirit in your own Hearts, and feel your Minds exerciſed in it, and you truly ſubject to the Leadings and Dictates of it, that you may be a Spiritual-minded People, and it is in

What! ſhall we forget the Hand that has Fed us, and dealt Bountifully with us? Nay, ſhall we ſpurn againſt him that hath given us Food and Raiment, and by his Providence hath preſerved us from the Dangers that have often attended, and given us Health and length of Days, and hath been as an open Fountain to us?

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57612:14"/> to abandon the World and Worldly-mindedneſs, with all the inducements that would draw thereto, to neglect our inward Exerciſe in the Gift of God towards him, and from being Faithful Stewards of what God, in Mercy, hath beſtowed upon us.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all keep their Minds within the bounds of Truth, and not launch out without the bounds of it, in an eager purſuit after the Riches of the VVorld, and thereby forget that Tender Frame of Spirit, and Breathing, which we ought to be in towards the Lord; for if this Tender Breathing Frame of Spirit be loſt, then Coldneſs will come in, our VVatch will be neglected, the Fear and Awe that ought to be upon our Minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God will ſlide off; and Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, and his dealings with us, will, by degrees, come in its place.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57612:16"/> what they are in their Nature, to induce the Unskilful Buyer, either to buy, or give more than the thing is really worth; for this is not Plain-dealing, this is not the way to anſwer the <hi>Witneſs of God</hi> in them, nor to ſpread the Honour and Reputation of Truth.</p>
            <p>And every one keep your VVords, and perform your<note n="(q)" place="margin">Pſal. 15. 4.</note> Contracts, to the utmoſt of your Power, that none may be injured or wronged, but that Truth may be ſeen to have the Government of your Minds in all things; for what will our Profeſſing this Bleſſed and Juſt Principle, and our Reaſoning and Diſputing for it, and telling the VVorld what a Heavenly Divine Juſt Principle it is, and what great things it will work in them that obey it; how it will make them Juſt and Righteous, and will make People careful what they do, and ſavory in all their words? I ſay, what will all this do, and abundance more, and not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57612:17"/> ſhew forth theſe Bleſſed Virtues and Effects of it in our Lives? VVhat will all our Profeſſing and Diſputing for it do? VVill this be a means to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Name of the Lord, and Juſtice and Equity in the Earth?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57612:23"/> for the Glory of the Name of the Lord, and for the preſervation of our Peace; this I entreat of all, that all things may be managed in Love and Brotherly kindneſs, in a Meek and Quiet Spirit, none ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for Maſtery, for there is to be no<note n="(z)" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> Lording over one another amongſt us, for we are Brethren, having one Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus. And as there is an abiding here, one Brother or Member cannot ſay to another, I have no need of thee (if they are really Members) but it is to be obſerved that none can be Members of this Body, nor have any Service there acceptable to God, but as they are in that life which makes them ſo, and that Life is Meek, Gentle, not Stuborn, Wilful, Heady and High-minded, for that, where-ever it appears, has another Head than Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> He that would lay waſte our Society, is their Head, and as it is unnatural for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

            <p>And, Dear Friends, in all matters that we are Concerned in to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, for the good of this Body, let Strife and Contention be avoided; the way to prevent the occaſion whereof is, by every ones keeping cloſe to the Truth, and to ſeek to promote that only; for where Truth only is Promoted, there is no occaſion of Strife; but when Men, through Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Affection, will Eſpouſe that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57612:24"/> which is wrong, and by Craft and Parts (not Subject to the Truth) will Uphold and Vindicate it, and force things upon others which they ought not; this lays a Foundation for Strife and Contention; and this may be oppoſed in a wrong Mind and Spirit; for where the Mans Part gets up to Contend, though againſt a wrong thing, this never does good; for the more it is given way to, the higher the Flame of Contention will riſe; and though this may, and does too often, happen; yet they that (in a Cool and Meek Spirit, and in a Concern for God, without any particular End to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others) do oppoſe what is wrong, are not the Cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; for there is a Diſtinction to be made between them that in Meekneſs Contend againſt what is wrong, and thoſe that would bring in that which ſhould not be brought in, and thereby cauſe Contention: For I obſerve the Apoſtle adviſeth,

            <p>And, Dear Friends, who are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Children, and Maſters and Miſtreſſes of Families, a great Care ought to be upon you, to anſwer the Truth in all things, and to dwell under the Government of it, that it may Seaſon and make Savory both your Words and Actions, that you may be good Patterns and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Virtue and Holineſs in all things. And take Care to Educate your Children in the Fear of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57612:25"/> Lord, and to Imprint a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lord in their Minds, in the days of their Youth; and to keep them out of the Evil Ways and Bad Words that are in the World, that they may not Learn the Evil Communication that is in the World, which doth Corrupt Good Manners; but bring them up in that Plainneſs and Moderation which the Truth leads into, and, as much as in you lies, in the Plain Language; having a Care you do not Indulge them, in any thing which you know the Lord in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath gathered you from: For if, through Affection, not Bounded by Truth, you Indulge your Children, in any thing that is wrong, you will neither be juſt to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren nor clear in the ſight of God; and from ſuch Unwarrantable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence we have ſeen the too often ſad Effects which have followed, by the degrees of Liberty, which ſuch Children have taken to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57612:26"/> and to gratifie their Looſe Vain Minds (which Youth is too much Inclin'd to) both in the Faſhions, Cuſtoms and Language of the World; and many from a nearneſs and affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the World, have run from the very Form and Appearance of Truth; which when, too late, their Indulgent Parents have began to ſee, their endeavours to ſtop them have proved Ineffectual; whereas, had they, like Boughs of a Tree, been taken whileſt Young and Tender, they might have been bended and made pliable; but having had ſo long a growth in the World's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their Stiffneſs hath been ſuch, that they would ſooner Break than Bend.</p>
            <p>Oh Friends! Be Careful, and Check every Appearance of the Worlds Nature and Spirit betimes, and endeavour to keep your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in that Awe and Subjection as is due to you, and becomes them; not in a ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now, where Parents do their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by Good Example, and alſo does Adviſe, Admoniſh, Reprove, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and Reſtrain (for in many caſes there is a Reſtraining Power, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Caſe of Old <hi>Ely;</hi>

I ſay, where Parents do Diſcharge themſelves, and are Clear in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57612:27"/> ſight of God, then if their Children will not be Reſtrain'd nor Prevail'd with, but will take their Courſe in thoſe By-paths that lead down to the Chambers of Death; although it is Sorrowful for Parents to ſee their Children do ſo, yet they have this Comfort (in their Sorrow) We are Clear of their Blood, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction lyes at their own Door: But on the other Hand, when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents behold their Children Steering their Courſe to Deſtruction, and, upon a ſearch, find they have not done their Duty, but have been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, either in not being good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, as they ought to have been, or have not Exerciſed that Power which God put into their Hands, but have let their Children have their own Ways and Wills, till it was too late to break them thereof: Oh!

And, Friends, let us rather Labour to have our Children Intituled to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, than to the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World; and when our Children are grown up, and fit to be Diſpoſed of in Marriage, let not the World, and the things of it be the Chief Object of our Minds, and to make them great therein, but let us rather Eye and Aim at Truth; for it is not outward<note n="(h)" place="margin">Luke 12. 15.</note> Riches and Injoyments that make People Happy in this World, but it is when Peoples Minds are ſubject to the Truth, and are Sanctified by it, and their Minds and Affections United in it, that brings Felicity and Happineſs in a Married State; for it is by the Truth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57612:28"/> that outward Injoyments are Bleſt and Sanctified, and truly made Comfortable to us; what better Portion can any have, than to have the Lord for their<note n="(i)" place="margin">Pſal. 16. 9. 6.</note> Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to be the Lot of their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance? They may then in Truth ſay, My Lot is fallen in a Good Ground, I have a Pleaſant Heritage; and that this may be the chief Aim and Drift of our Minds, both for our ſelves and our Children, are the Hearty Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of my Soul to the Lord.</p>
            <p>And as there is a Care and Duty that ought to be upon Parents to Educate their Children in the Fear of the Lord, ſo there is a Duty upon Children to Parents, to have an Awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Regard to them, and to Love them, and be ſubject to them; not to be Stubborn, Self-will'd, Heady, High-minded or Perverſe, but to be Meek and Gentle, willing to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, Tender, Condeſcending and Affectionate; Conſidering the great Care and Pains Parents have taken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57612:29"/> for them many ways, and therefore ought not to be Rewarded with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalneſs, Diſobedience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but with a Meek Condeſcending Compliance in all Honeſt and Lawful things, and this brings Parents and Children to have Comfort one in another, and a Bleſſing from God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both.</p>
            <p>And alſo, as touching Servants, there ought to be a Care upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Miſtreſſes ſo to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Servants, as that they may anſwer the Witneſs of God in them, and yet keep that Authority as in their Places in the Truth, not in a Lordly Spirit, nor a High Severe Cruel Mind, but in the Savouryneſs of the Truth, not giving way upon Provocations that may be given (tho' it may be a Fault in them that gives them) to fly out into Rage and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and conſequently into Raſh and Unſavoury Words, as calling Uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Unproper Names, and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Expreſſions; for when Paſſion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57612:29"/> exceeds the Bounds of Reaſon, then the Tongue is at Liberty to expreſs that which is Unſavoury, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards has cauſe, many times, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; but where Fults are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, let ſuch Reproof be given in a good Temper of Mind as carries a Convinceing Authority along with it; this is the way to anſwer the good in them, and keep down that which is contrary in our ſelves; and as it is juſt and equal for Maſters to expect and require of Servants a diligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Service and Work for which they take Wages, ſo on the other hand, Servants ought not to be Cruelly Uſed nor Oppreſſed in their Service; but that Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Truth leads into, uſed and lived in on both hands, and then they that are ſerved will have quiet and content in them that Serve, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants will have Comfort in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and thereby the Truth and Reputation of it will be Promoted, and Love and Concord Increaſe.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57612:30"/> And Servants ought alſo to behave themſelves in their places, Juſtly and Faithfully, in a conſidering Mind, with due Reſpect to thoſe they ſerve, in all Quietneſs and Diligence, not as<note n="(k)" place="margin">Eph. 6. 6.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57612:30"/> to let in a Spirit of Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt towards thoſe you ſerve, nor to give way to Whiſpering nor Tale-bearing, for that many times breeds Diſturbances in Families, and many times occaſions Differences between Friends; it is of a very ill Tendency, and ought be watch'd againſt and condemned, that ſo the Bleſſed Truth may Flouriſh, and both Servants and Maſters, in their places, may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the Hand of the Lord, by their Juſt and Good Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the Inlarging the borders of Truth and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, to God's Glory, and the Mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one of another.</p>
